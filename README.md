## Description

This workspace includes the mission tasks modelling and parametrization tools developed within the CONCERT project. The  repository comes with a docker setup which inherits from the `fhi_mission_stack:release` and thus can access the robotic skill library from the fhi_mission_stack. Application specific skills for the CONCERT project are hosted in this workspace.

## How to run

The bt_action_server is the application that runs a ROS2 action server and recieves a BehaviorTreeDescriptor request to run a behavior tree through the bt_executor. Run the bt_action_server:

```
ros2 launch bt_action_server send_bt_action_server.launch.py
```
