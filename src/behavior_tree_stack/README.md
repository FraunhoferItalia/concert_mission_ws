# Fraunhofer Italia Behavior Tree Stack

Author: [Michael Terzer](mailto:michael.terzer@fraunhofer.it) - Fraunhofer Italia (2022-2024)

This stack of ROS2 packages provides a framework to manage and execute behavior trees. It provides a plugin-based architecture to load custom behavior tree nodes, or so called skills. It is based on the [BehaviorTree.CPP](https://www.behaviortree.dev/) library and uses the interfaces of the [BehaviorTree.ROS2](https://github.com/BehaviorTree/BehaviorTree.ROS2) repository.

The **bt_executor** package hosts several classes to execute a behavior tree and to manage the so called skill libraries, being behavior-tree-node-plugins that can be hosted in separate packages somewhere in your workspace. A demo of such skills can be found in **bt_demo_skills**.

The **bt_action_server** package implements a ROS2 action server that uses a bt_executor instance to run a tree. The tree can be loaded from a path or sent as a string, accompanied with a blackboard to the executor.

The **bt_service_server** package implements mutiple ROS2 service servers that wrap some base-class functions from the bt_executor package as ROS2 services. 

The **behavior_tree_msgs** package collects message types that are used within this stack.

The **bt_demo_kills** package demonstrates the implementation of skills that are loaded by the **bt_skill_manager** from the **bt_executor** package.

For more detailed information, please see the specific package documentations.

## Cloning

This repository comes with a [vcs-tool](https://github.com/dirk-thomas/vcstool) setup. Import the needed repositories by:

```
vcs import < .repos
```

## Docker

The stack comes with a docker-compose setup.

### Build the docker

To build the docker, navigate to the docker directory and run:

```
cd docker
docker compose build
```

### Run a simple demo in the docker container

Run the docker:

```
docker compose up 
```

Open a bash of the container:

```
docker exec -it bt_stack /bin/bash
```

Within the container, build the workspace:

```
colcon build
```

Run the demo application in the container:

```
source install/setup.bash && ros2 launch bt_demo_skills behavior_tree.launch.py
```
